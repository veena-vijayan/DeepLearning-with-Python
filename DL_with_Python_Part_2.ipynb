        "    1. Modularity: A model can be understood as a sequence or a graph alone. All the concerns of a deep learning model are discrete components that can be combined in arbitrary ways.\n",
        "    2. Minimalism: The library provides just enough to achieve an outcome, no frills and maximizing readability.\n",
        "    3. Extensibility: New components are intentionally easy to add and use within the frame-work, intended for developers to trial and explore new ideas.\n",
        "    4. Python: No separate model files with custom file formats. Everything is native Python.\n",
