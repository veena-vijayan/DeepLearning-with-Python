The following are my notes on **Deep Learning with Python book by Jason Brownlee**. 

The book is mainly divided into six parts: <br />

<ol type=I>
  <li>Part 1: Introduction</li>
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    A general introduction into the book, the book organization and a general introduction into the other parts of the book.
  
  <li>Part 2: Background</li>  
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    Introduction into Theano, TensorFlow and Keras libraries that lay the foundation for your deep learning journey and about how you can leverage very cheap Amazon Web Service computing in order to develop and evaluate your own large models in the cloud. Kindly note that *Chapter 5: Project: Develop Large Models on GPUs Cheaply In the Cloud* - is not included here.
  
  <li>Part 3: Multilayer Perceptrons</li>
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    In this part you will learn about feedforward neural networks that may be deep or not and how to expertly develop your own networks and evaluate them efficiently using Keras. These important lessons are tied together with three foundation projects. These projects demonstrate how you can quickly and efficiently develop neural network models for tabular data and provide project templates that you can use on your own regression and classiffication machine learning problems.
  
  <li>Part 4: Advanced Multilayer Perceptrons</li>
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    In this part you will learn about some of the more finer points of the Keras library and API for practical machine learning projects and some of the more important developments in applied neural networks that you need to know in order to deliver world class results.
  
  <li>Part 5: Convolutional Neural Networks</li>
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    In this part you will receive a crash course in the dominant model for computer vision machine learning problems and some natural language problems and how you can best exploit the capabilities of the Keras API for your own projects. You will work through three larger projects and apply CNN to image data for object recognition and text data for sentiment classiffication. 
    
  <li>Part 6: Recurrent Neural Networks</li>
    <code>&nbsp;</code>
    In this part you will receive a crash course in the dominant model for data with a sequence or time component and how you can best exploit the capabilities of the Keras API for your own projects. You will work through two larger projects and apply RNN to sequence classiffication and text generation.
</ol>

The project is work in progress and will be updating the notebooks and parts as and when completed. The notebooks contain a snapshot of the lesson and also the example problem along with it.

Note: It is advised to open the notebooks via Google Colab *(Google Colab is a free cloud service and now it supports free GPU! You can; improve your Python programming language coding skills. develop deep learning applications using popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV)*. This allows you to view the images and code better - it can be done by clicking the google colab link on top of the notebook.
